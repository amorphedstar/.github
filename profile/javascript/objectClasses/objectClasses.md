# JavaScript object and classes

ðŸ“– **Deeper dive reading**: [MDN Classes in JavaScript](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/JavaScript/Objects/Classes_in_JavaScript)

A JavaScript object represents a collection of name value pairs referred to as properties. The property name must be of type String or Symbol, but the value can be of any type. Objects also have common object-oriented functionality such as constructors, a `this` pointer, static properties and functions, and inheritance.

Objects can be created with the new operator. This causes the object's constructor to be called. Once declared you can add properties to the object by simply referencing the property name in an assignment. Any type of variable can be assigned to a property. This includes a sub-object, array, or function. The properties of an object can be referenced either with dot (`obj.prop`) or bracket notation (`obj['prop']`).

```js
const obj = new Object({a:3});
obj['b'] = 'fish';
obj.c = [1, 2, 3];
obj.hello = function () {
  console.log('hello');
};

console.log(obj);
// OUTPUT: {a: 3, b: 'fish', c: [1,2,3], hello: func}
```

The ability to dynamically modify an object is incredibly useful when manipulating data with an indeterminate structure.

âš  Note the different uses of the term `object`. Object can refer to the standard JavaScript objects (e.g. `Promise, Map, Object, Function, Date, ...`), or it can refer specifically to the JavaScript Object object (i.e. `new Object()`), or it can refer to any JavaScript object you create (e.g. `{a:'a', b:2}` ). This overloaded usage can be a bit confusing.

## Object-literals

You can also declare a variable of object type with the `object-literal` syntax. This syntax allows you to provide the initial composition of the object.

```js
const obj = {
  a: 3,
  b: 'fish',
};
```

## Object functions

Object has several interesting static functions associated with it. Here are some of the commonly used ones.

| Function | Meaning                             |
| -------- | ----------------------------------- |
| entries  | Returns an array of key value pairs |
| keys     | Returns an array of keys            |
| values   | Returns an array of values          |

```js
const obj = {
  a: 3,
  b: 'fish',
};

console.log(Object.entries(obj));
// OUTPUT: [['a', 3],Â ['b', 'fish']]
console.log(Object.keys(obj));
// OUTPUT: ['a', 'b']
console.log(Object.values(obj));
// OUTPUT: [3, 'fish']
```

## Constructor

Any function that returns an object is considered a `constructor` and can be invoked with the `new` operator.

```js
function Person(name) {
  return {
    name: name,
  };
}

const p = new Person('Eich');
console.log(p);
// OUTPUT: {name: 'Eich'}
```

Because objects can have any type of property value you can create methods on the object as part of its encapsulation.

```js
function Person(name) {
  return {
    name: name,
    log: function () {
      console.log('My name is ' + this.name);
    },
  };
}

const p = new Person('Eich');
p.log();
// OUTPUT: My name is Eich
```

## This pointer

Notice in the last example the use of the keyword `this` when we referred to the name property (`this.name`). The meaning of `this` depends upon the scope of where it is used, but in the context of an object it refers to a pointer to the object. We will talk more about the `this` pointer in the instruction on scope.

## Classes

You can use classes to define objects. Using a class clarifies the intent to create a reusable component rather than a one-off object. Class declarations look similar to declaring an object, but classes have an explicit constructor and assumed function declarations. The person object from above would look like the following when converted to a class.

```js
class Person {
  constructor(name) {
    this.name = name;
  }

  log() {
    console.log('My name is ' + this.name);
  }
}

const p = new Person('Eich');
p.log();
// OUTPUT: My name is Eich
```

You can make properties and functions of classes private by prefixing them with a `#`.

```js
class Person {
  #name;

  constructor(name) {
    this.#name = name;
  }
}

const p = new Person('Eich');
p.#name = 'Lie';
// OUTPUT: Uncaught SyntaxError: Private field '#name' must be declared in an enclosing class
```

## Inheritance

Classes can be extended by using the `extends` keyword to define inheritance. Parameters that need to be passed to the parent class are delivered using the `super` function. Any functions defined on the child that have the same name as the parent override the parent's implementation. A parent's function can be explicitly accessed using the `super` keyword.

```js
class Person {
  constructor(name) {
    this.name = name;
  }

  print() {
    return 'My name is ' + this.name;
  }
}

class Employee extends Person {
  constructor(name, position) {
    super(name);
    this.position = position;
  }

  print() {
    return super.print() + '. I am a ' + this.position;
  }
}

const e = new Employee('Eich', 'programmer');
console.log(e.print());
// OUTPUT: My name is Eich. I am a programmer
```

## â˜‘ Assignment

Create a CodePen that starts with the following code

```js
class Phone {
  constructor(regEx) {
    // Implement the constructor
  }

  // Implement the Connected constant getter

  connect(...numberParts) {
    // Return an object if the number matches the regEx
    // Otherwise thrown an exception
  }
}

const phone = new Phone(/\d{3}-\d{3}-\d{4}/);

const calls = [
  { name: 'Li', number: ['333', '333', '3333'] },
  { name: 'Juan', number: ['222', '222', '2222'] },
  { name: 'Meg', number: ['8E26F', '811F'] },
];

for (const call of calls) {
  try {
    const { result } = phone.connect(...call.number);
    if (result === Phone.Connected) {
      console.log(`called ${call.name}`);
    }
  } catch (ex) {
    console.log(`${ex.message} for ${call.name}`);
  } finally {
    console.log('done');
  }
}
```

and implements the following functionality of the Phone class:

1. Has a constructor that accepts a regular expression as a parameter. The regular expression is stored on the object for future reference.
1. Has a `Connected` getter that defines a constant for the class that is set to a value of 'connected'.
1. Has a `connect` method that takes a variable number of values. The method joins the values together into a string that is separated by a '-' character and attempts to match it with the regular expression given in the constructor. If it fails it throws an exception. Otherwise it passes back an object that has an `id` and `result` property, where the result is set to Phone.Connected.

Once you have implemented the Phone class. Examine the CodePen console output. It should look like this:

```sh
called Li
done
called Juan
done
invalid number for Meg
done
```

When you get this result, submit your CodePen URL to the Canvas assignment.

Don't forget to update your GitHub startup repository notes.md with all of the things you learned and want to remember.
